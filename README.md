The code for chat application can be found [here](https://github.com/Legedith/hedera-hcs-chat-js)

This application is built on top of [Hedera's demo chat application](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-hcs-chat-js).

It has a text to speech option for reading out all the chats which makes it read out loud all the incoming messages.
